# Mark Cleverdon

I've been developing applications for various companies over the years. My journey in technology has evolved from QuickBasic to Foxpro, LAMP, JavaScript, jQuery, and most recently Angular/TypeScript/Ionic PWAs. Throughout, my constant aim has been to find the most practical and simplified solutions for end users.

Living on an island dedicated to tourism, much of my work has revolved around supporting the tourism business environment. This includes developing reservation systems, tour guide admin tools, and double-entry accounting systems.

The world of development is evolving rapidly, and we, as developers, must evolve with it.

## My Projects

### Client Area

Client Area is a PWA designed for **Holiday Property Management** companies. It helps clients consolidate their booking, arrival, passport, accommodation, and location information in one place. This app improves the client experience and strengthens their relationship with the management company.

#### Included Features
1. Welcome letter, FAQ's, Terms and Conditions.
2. Booking payment status and an online payment link to complete payments.
3. Accommodation "info-book" with address, key, safe location, and property-specific information.
4. Accommodation location map - how to get there.
5. Arrival and flight details - helps prepare everything before the client's arrival.
6. Passport/ID scanner with OCR (Tesseract) to comply with legal travel requirements.
7. User authenticity checks for data security.
8. FCM Push notifications for reminders and special offers (a valuable marketing tool).
9. App config/preferences to adjust push notifications and device memory usage.

#### Planned Features (TODO)
1. Availability search for future bookings.
2. Internal communication tool (similar to WhatsApp) for the management teams' departments - Maintenance, Reservations, Administration, etc.

### ExControl

ExControl is a server-based **PHP** application for the administration of tourist guide invoicing.

In tourist destinations worldwide, tours of historical, cultural, and traditional attractions are common. Local guides are often organized by companies that handle administration and liaise with tour operators. This application simplifies all necessary administration work, including invoicing tour operators for each excursion and paying guides in their portfolio.

Simplify your life and use the right tools.
