Hi I am Mark Cleverdon

I have developed web applications for companies for many years and the technology I have used has evolved from QuickBasic through Foxpro, LAMP, Javascript JQuery and most recently Angular/Typescript/Ionic PWA's.

My constant has always been to find the most practical and simplified solution for the end user posible.

As I live on an island that is dedicated to tourism most of my work has been to support the tourist bussines environment from reservations systems, tour guide admin tools and double entry accounts systems.

The development world has evolved dramatically and we as developers must too.

# My Projects

## Client Area

Client area is a PWA for **Holiday Property Management** companies to help the clients to have all of their booking, Arrival, Passport, accommodation, location information in one place. The special characteristics of *self catering holiday homes* make it difficult to centralise all of the clients holiday information and provide adequate real time up to date information. This app is designed to improve the client experience and consolidate their relationship with the management company.

### Included features
1) Welcome letter, FAQ's, Terms and conditions.
2) Booking payment status and online payment link to complete.
3) Accommodation "info-book" with address, key, safe location and all other property specific information.
4) Accommodation location map - how to get there.
5) Arrival and flight details - helps preparing everything before the client arrival.
6) Passport/ID scanner with OCR (tesseract) to comply with legal travel requirements.
7) User authenticity check for data security.
8) FCM Push notifications for reminders and special offers etc. (a valuable marketing tool)
9) App config/preferences to adjust push notifications, device memory usage etc.

### Planned features (TODO)

1) Availability search for future bookings
2) Internal comunication tool (like whatsapp) with the management teams departments - Maintenance, Reservations, Administration etc.

## ExControl

Excontrol is a server based **PHP** application for the administration of tourist guide invoicing.

All over the world the are tourist destinations where you can take a tour of many hostorical/cultural/traditional attractions. The local guides are very often organized by companies that handle the administration and liase with tour operators to supply the adequately experienced guide with the language/s needed for the tour.

This application brings together and greatly simplifies all of the necessary administration work. Invoicing the tour operators for each excursion and also paying out each of the guides in their portfolio.

Make life simple and use the right tools.
