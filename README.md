Hi I am Mark Paul Cleverdon

I have developed web applications for companies for many years and the technology I have used has evolved from QuickBasic through Foxpro, LAMP, Javascript JQuery and most recently Angular/Typescript/Ionic PWA's.

My constant has always been to find the most practical and simplified solution for the end user posible.

As I live on an island that is dedicated to tourism most of my work has been to support the tourist bussines environment from reservations systems, tour guide admin tools and double entry accounts systems.

The development world has evolved dramatically and we as developers must too.
